CCUI is a Web-based customer care application for a Client. It provides a secure means for carrier’s customer care representatives (CSRs) to perform prepaid card tasks and maintain subscriber’s account through internet. CCUI also allows carrier’s supervisory personnel to manage their own CSR accounts. Carriers can create accounts, change settings and privileges and decommission accounts as required.
The time‐out occurs if no activity is recorded by the application within 30 minutes of use. User screen may look the same as last used screen, but it turns inactive. Any changes that are made which were not saved prior to the time‐out are lost.
If time‐out occurs, then user is directed to Login Screen. Again user has to log in and check the subscriber’s account to ensure whether the changes made were saved.
